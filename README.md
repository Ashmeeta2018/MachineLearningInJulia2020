## Options for running the tutorials


### 1. Plug-and-play

Recommended for users with little Julia experience or users having
problems with the other options. 

If you never run a Julia/Juptyer notebook on your local machine, never
used a Julia IDE before, or never cloned a GitHub repository, then use
this option.


#### Pros

No need to install Julia or any libraries on your local machine


#### Cons

- The (automatic) setup can take a little while

- If the online notebook crashes or drops your connection, you will have to start over


#### Instructions

### 2. Clone the repo and choose your preferred interface

Assumes that you have a working installation of Julia 1.3 or higher and that either:

- You can run Julia/Juptyer notebooks on your local machine without problems; or

- You are comfortable running Julia scripts from an IDE, such as [Juno](https://junolab.org) or [Emacs](https://github.com/JuliaEditorSupport/julia-emacs) (see the bottom of [this page](https://julialang.org) for a complete list).


#### Pros

More stable option

#### Cons

You need to meet above requirements


#### Instructions

- Clone this repository

- Change to your local repo directory "MachineLearningInJulia2020/"

- Either run the Juptyper notebook called "tutorials.ipynb", or open
  "tutorials.jl" in your favourite IDE
